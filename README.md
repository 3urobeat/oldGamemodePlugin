# oldGamemode-Plugin

This super cool and lightweight plugin for Spigot and Bukkit servers allows you to use the `/gamemode` command the old and cool way!  
  
This plugin is designed to replicate the exact behaviour of the vanilla command but also allowing the usage of the old numeric game modes and the shorter `/gm` command.  
(With the limitation that only English is supported)
  
Download the .jar: https://github.com/HerrEurobeat/oldGamemodePlugin/releases/latest  
...and put it into the `plugins` folder of your Spigot/Bukkit server. **Done!**  

## Usage

Type `/gm` or `/gamemode` in the chat to see all options in the auto completion.
